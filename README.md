A simplified web-based application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5 inspired by the popular ticket-booking platform, BookMyShow. The project features a responsive design with dynamic movie listings, detailed movie information, and a functional ticket booking system. Users can view available movies, check details, and book tickets via an animated modal. The application includes smooth animations, and a styled footer with contact and social links, making it a visually appealing and interactive project.

Screenshots of the output:
**Home Page:** This is the home page of the application. It features a navigation bar and movie tiles. Below the navigation bar, the text "Now Showing" is animated to slide from one end of the page to the other.
